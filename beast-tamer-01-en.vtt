00:15.080 --> 00:16.070
Rein...

00:20.360 --> 00:21.960
You're fired.

01:59.590 --> 02:03.430
(Meeting of Fate)

02:08.820 --> 02:09.940
<i>Beast Tamer.</i>

02:10.980 --> 02:13.730
<i>It's a class that is able to communicate</i>

02:13.730 --> 02:15.880
<i>and enter into contracts 
with many kinds of animals...</i>

02:15.880 --> 02:18.280
<i>Taming their strength as your own.</i>

02:22.620 --> 02:25.290
<i>Beast Tamers aren't well-suited to combat,</i>

02:31.040 --> 02:35.590
<i>but I worked hard to support my 
comrades during our harsh journey,</i>

02:35.590 --> 02:39.900
<i>and my comrades in the 
Hero's party trusted me for it.</i>

02:41.630 --> 02:43.100
<i>Or... so I thought.</i>

02:48.800 --> 02:51.210
Um, hang on a sec.

02:51.210 --> 02:53.980
This is kind of sudden, 
so I'm not sure I follow...

02:53.980 --> 02:56.250
Wait, is this a prank?

02:57.000 --> 02:59.030
Of course not.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.560
Arios...

03:01.770 --> 03:02.800
Aggath?

03:03.200 --> 03:04.340
Leane?

03:05.660 --> 03:06.540
Mina?

03:07.620 --> 03:10.330
You're... serious about this?

03:11.250 --> 03:13.670
I-I want to know why!

03:15.410 --> 03:16.460
You want a reason?

03:17.110 --> 03:19.170
You mean other than the obvious one?

03:19.170 --> 03:22.100
It's because you're useless!

03:22.100 --> 03:24.600
You don't serve any purpose!

03:24.890 --> 03:26.100
Do you get it now?

03:26.100 --> 03:27.470
You've been holding us back so much,

03:27.470 --> 03:30.520
you even being around 
is more trouble than its worth!

03:31.220 --> 03:32.430
I am...?

03:32.430 --> 03:34.480
You have to have noticed, right?

03:34.480 --> 03:36.940
You never do any damage to our enemies,

03:36.940 --> 03:39.900
and we're constantly having to save you.

03:40.510 --> 03:43.250
All you really contribute 
is scouting and carriage,

03:43.250 --> 03:45.160
using the animals that you've tamed.

03:45.510 --> 03:49.100
Doesn't that sound worthless to you?

03:49.100 --> 03:51.330
It was asking too much of
 him in the first place.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.330
<i>What is this...?</i>

03:51.330 --> 03:53.650
We don't have time for babysitting.

03:53.650 --> 03:57.740
I was always against letting 
a Beast Tamer join up.

03:57.740 --> 03:59.580
Don't be like that.

03:59.580 --> 04:04.870
Worthless as he is, I thought he could 
shine by sharing the same spotlight as me.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.050
Arios, you are so kind!

04:07.050 --> 04:09.540
Very. The only sin here lies with this man

04:09.540 --> 04:13.890
who has wasted the grace of the Hero, Arios.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.900
<i>This is what my party thought 
of me this whole time?</i>

04:15.800 --> 04:17.470
I... This can't—

04:17.470 --> 04:18.520
Rein...

04:20.320 --> 04:23.280
Don't lower our opinion of you 
any more than you already have.

04:25.370 --> 04:28.220
And make sure to leave your gear behind.

04:28.220 --> 04:30.290
We're the ones who gathered it.

04:31.060 --> 04:34.510
This means we can finally 
take on the Lost Woods.

04:34.510 --> 04:36.100
We've waited long enough.

04:35.060 --> 04:36.100
I understand.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.910
This town is big, but there's nothing in it, 
and we've been here for days.

04:39.910 --> 04:43.080
How long was he going to spend 
on gathering supplies, anyway?

04:43.080 --> 04:46.240
We were mistaken to have even 
the most modest hopes for him.

04:46.240 --> 04:48.220
Let us simply consider this a brief respite.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.660
Good idea!

04:49.660 --> 04:53.930
When you put of it that way, maybe he
 was of some use at the very end.

04:52.650 --> 04:53.930
<i>In that moment...</i>

04:54.590 --> 04:58.900
<i>It felt like anything between us 
had come to a permanent end.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:22.800
You're weak, like a child.

05:23.150 --> 05:28.340
You still seem to lack both the bearing 
and the skill required of the Hero's party.

05:28.770 --> 05:32.180
Are you ever going to be good 
for anything besides running errands?

05:33.290 --> 05:34.430
So worthless...

05:34.430 --> 05:38.650
No need to be so harsh. 
Rein is trying his best.

05:39.240 --> 05:41.900
<i>At least, for a Beast Tamer!</i>

05:42.530 --> 05:45.530
<i>I thought the reason they were so hard on me</i>

05:45.530 --> 05:48.740
<i>was because they had high hopes 
for what I could accomplish.</i>

05:49.300 --> 05:50.300
<i>But...</i>

05:50.930 --> 05:54.580
<i>Maybe they never cared 
about me in the first place.</i>

05:54.580 --> 05:58.730
But more importantly, what do I do now?

05:59.310 --> 06:01.610
No goal, no gear, and no coin.

06:01.610 --> 06:04.530
I'm starting with next to nothing.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.800
Rein!

06:07.740 --> 06:09.600
Did you finish your job for the Hero?

06:09.600 --> 06:11.250
Uh, actually...

06:11.250 --> 06:12.940
Do the thing then, come on!

06:12.940 --> 06:13.850
Please!

06:13.850 --> 06:15.080
Come on, please!

06:15.080 --> 06:16.320
Do it! Go on!

06:16.320 --> 06:17.180
Okay!

06:20.840 --> 06:22.360
So, for today...

06:28.990 --> 06:29.940
There.

06:31.420 --> 06:33.440
That's the temporary contract.

06:34.300 --> 06:35.700
Go on, say hello.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.690
Wow!

06:39.690 --> 06:40.980
Nice job.

06:40.980 --> 06:41.750
And thank you.

06:44.540 --> 06:45.290
Bye-bye!

06:45.290 --> 06:46.700
See you around!

06:49.170 --> 06:50.690
There it goes...

06:50.690 --> 06:54.260
Well, like I told you, 
that contract was only temporary.

06:54.260 --> 06:58.670
They're easy to form, 
but they don't last very long.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.370
Maybe that was a little hard to understand?

07:03.370 --> 07:05.570
You really are awesome, Rein!

07:05.570 --> 07:08.280
I wanna be a Beast Tamer when I grow up!

07:08.280 --> 07:09.200
Me, too!

07:09.200 --> 07:10.560
Me, too!

07:09.650 --> 07:10.560
Huh...

07:10.560 --> 07:12.740
I thought you said you wanted 
to be a hero before?

07:12.740 --> 07:16.290
I mean, the Hero and his party 
always look annoyed

07:16.290 --> 07:18.690
when commoners like us come up to them!

07:18.690 --> 07:21.720
Even though they suck up 
to rich folks and nobles...

07:21.720 --> 07:23.440
It's kind of nasty, right?

07:23.440 --> 07:24.330
And scary.

07:24.330 --> 07:28.090
I didn't know people thought that way 
about Arios and the party.

07:28.090 --> 07:32.300
I guess that explains the reception 
I got whenever I went to buy supplies.

07:32.690 --> 07:34.790
You're different though, Rein!

07:34.790 --> 07:37.210
You always play with us!

07:37.210 --> 07:38.270
And you're nice!

07:39.850 --> 07:42.410
<i>It's gonna be even harder 
to tell them I got fired now.</i>

07:42.410 --> 07:45.760
So I'm gonna be an adventurer, 
and travel all over!

07:45.760 --> 07:47.560
And make a fortune overnight!

07:47.560 --> 07:48.440
A fortune!

07:48.440 --> 07:51.440
A fortune overnight! A fortune overnight!

07:48.730 --> 07:50.000
An adventurer...

07:53.140 --> 07:56.540
<i>Living like a migratory bird on 
the wing, free to live or die as I please.</i>

07:57.180 --> 08:02.410
<i>Making a living off my skills 
by taking jobs as an adventurer?</i>

08:03.550 --> 08:06.780
<i>Now that I don't need to worry 
about defeating the Demon King,</i>

08:06.780 --> 08:08.550
<i>it might be the perfect job for me.</i>

08:09.960 --> 08:10.920
Okay!

08:11.860 --> 08:14.220
Welcome to the Adventurer's Guild!

08:14.720 --> 08:16.740
I'm Natalie, the receptionist.

08:16.740 --> 08:19.430
Let's start with an explanation 
of the adventurer's trial.

08:19.430 --> 08:23.680
Could you tell me a bit more 
about being an adventurer first?

08:23.680 --> 08:27.360
I hate to admit it, but I actually 
don't know that much.

08:28.490 --> 08:31.010
<i>Arios and the others 
looked down on adventurers,</i>

08:31.010 --> 08:33.280
<i>so we didn't interact with them much.</i>

08:34.250 --> 08:35.940
You're an earnest one, aren't you?

08:35.940 --> 08:39.360
Most of the applicants don't really 
put too much thought into it...

08:39.360 --> 08:41.710
Personally, I think you're 
on the right track!

08:41.710 --> 08:42.970
You really do?

08:42.970 --> 08:44.580
I really do!

08:44.580 --> 08:46.880
Let's start at the beginning, then.

08:47.210 --> 08:52.200
Adventurers, like monsters, 
are assigned ranks from S to F...

09:00.160 --> 09:01.430
...and that's everything.

09:01.900 --> 09:04.110
Is there anything else 
you had questions about?

09:04.110 --> 09:05.600
Nope. Thank you.

09:05.600 --> 09:06.900
I should be good, now.

09:07.700 --> 09:10.870
In that case, let's move onto 
the matter of the adventurer's trial.

09:10.870 --> 09:12.730
What's your class?

09:13.040 --> 09:14.500
Beast Tamer.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.200
Beast Tamer?!

09:16.660 --> 09:20.200
Um... will you be okay by yourself?

09:20.200 --> 09:22.740
It's because you're useless!

09:23.480 --> 09:25.960
Don't do anything reckless, okay?

09:25.960 --> 09:29.820
Adventurers need to know 
when a job is too much.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.300
Right. Of course.

09:36.670 --> 09:39.220
Do you understand why 
the guild requires a trial

09:39.220 --> 09:41.720
in order to be registered as an adventurer?

09:42.010 --> 09:45.240
Is it because if there were 
a bunch of unskilled adventurers,

09:45.240 --> 09:47.690
it'd undermine trust in the guild?

09:47.690 --> 09:50.520
Correct! Well done!

09:50.520 --> 09:53.860
And without that trust, 
the government would get involved.

09:55.340 --> 10:00.550
But putting that aside, the details 
of the trial involve slaying ten goblins,

10:00.550 --> 10:02.890
and collecting 20 medicinal herbs.

10:02.890 --> 10:07.830
Adventurers take on a variety 
hunting and collection jobs,

10:07.830 --> 10:12.290
so this is the bare minimum required 
to pass muster with the guild.

10:20.110 --> 10:21.420
That's ten.

10:23.060 --> 10:26.290
Thanks for helping me find the goblins.

10:29.780 --> 10:35.180
I guess even a Beast Tamer can 
handle F-ranked monsters like them.

10:35.790 --> 10:37.740
I've got the rune stones from the goblins,

10:37.740 --> 10:41.050
so I just need to gather the herbs 
and head back to the guild...

10:41.570 --> 10:42.600
A scream?

10:42.600 --> 10:43.610
It's from further in the forest!

10:48.780 --> 10:50.140
A Killer Tiger?!

10:50.700 --> 10:51.610
Oh, no!

10:52.510 --> 10:54.630
<i>The D-Ranked monster Killer Tiger.</i>

10:55.270 --> 10:59.090
<i>Even a veteran adventurer could be killed 
by one of these if they weren't careful!</i>

11:10.880 --> 11:13.540
<i>And of course, I don't stand a chance.</i>

11:14.110 --> 11:14.980
<i>But...</i>

11:15.890 --> 11:17.040
<i>It's better this way.</i>

11:18.320 --> 11:19.240
Hey, you!

11:19.870 --> 11:21.150
Can you move?

11:21.150 --> 11:22.410
You need to run while you can!

11:28.700 --> 11:30.700
<i>No monsters to tame.</i>

11:31.290 --> 11:33.250
<i>No weapons to use.</i>

11:34.090 --> 11:37.820
<i>But I can at least buy her 
enough time to get away...</i>

11:40.410 --> 11:42.660
Wh-Why are you still there?!

11:42.660 --> 11:44.590
With the last...

11:45.900 --> 11:47.840
Of my strength...

12:14.090 --> 12:17.830
<i>Wow. She took down 
a Killer Tiger in one blow.</i>

12:18.600 --> 12:20.550
Just who are you?

12:26.460 --> 12:31.480
<i>There are beings of inexplicable power 
in this world known as ultimate species.</i>

12:31.980 --> 12:35.200
<i>Dragonoids. Fairies. Demigods.</i>

12:35.200 --> 12:37.620
<i>They all count among the ultimate species.</i>

12:37.940 --> 12:41.360
<i>But one of them is more rare than the rest.</i>

12:41.360 --> 12:42.280
<i>And that is...</i>

12:46.620 --> 12:48.700
A Cat Spirit?

12:50.240 --> 12:54.540
And... I... am... done.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.510
Hey!

12:57.060 --> 13:00.060
Hey, are you all right? Were you hurt?

13:00.060 --> 13:01.160
Say something!

13:02.070 --> 13:02.960
So...

13:02.960 --> 13:04.060
So?

13:05.680 --> 13:08.640
So hungry...

13:19.730 --> 13:22.440
She's... the real deal?

13:23.100 --> 13:24.780
<i>Despite being one of the ultimate species,</i>

13:24.780 --> 13:27.410
<i>the Cat Spirits are said to be 
on the verge of extinction.</i>

13:28.000 --> 13:32.140
<i>They can't use magic, but they've 
evolved to have athletic abilities</i>

13:32.140 --> 13:34.410
<i>that make them among 
the ultimate in the world.</i>

13:36.960 --> 13:38.500
<i>And she really is one?</i>

13:40.290 --> 13:42.400
Thank you so much! You're a life-saver.

13:42.400 --> 13:44.820
I thought I was gonna die back there.

13:44.820 --> 13:47.350
I'm just glad I had some 
traveling rations on me.

13:47.350 --> 13:49.220
Still, are you sure you're not exaggerating?

13:49.220 --> 13:50.620
Not at all!

13:50.620 --> 13:52.810
I've gone days without 
anything to eat or drink.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.390
I could see my grandparents 
in heaven waving me over.

13:57.390 --> 14:00.170
<i>She must've been in pretty rough shape.</i>

14:00.170 --> 14:03.050
That would've been another 
step toward extinction.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.800
<i>Okay, extremely bad shape!</i>

14:04.800 --> 14:07.360
Oh, I never introduced myself, did I?

14:07.790 --> 14:11.560
My name's Kanade! 
As you can see, I'm a Cat Spirit.

14:11.560 --> 14:12.830
Nice to meet you!

14:13.460 --> 14:15.160
I'm Rein Shroud.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.450
I ran into you in the middle 
of my adventurer's trial, miss.

14:19.540 --> 14:20.800
Wh-What is it?

14:20.800 --> 14:23.880
I'd rather you call me "Kanade" than "miss."

14:27.380 --> 14:29.180
Okay, if you call me Rein.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.010
Okay then, Rein!

14:33.090 --> 14:35.430
I'm glad you're the one who helped me!

14:35.700 --> 14:39.490
What were you doing out here 
in the first place, Kanade?

14:40.130 --> 14:43.680
I mean, it's kind of strange 
to find an endangered Cat Spirit

14:43.680 --> 14:45.920
in some unremarkable forest...

14:46.980 --> 14:49.360
I've just been traveling, is all.

14:49.710 --> 14:54.700
There's not many of us, so we 
live quietly, deep in the mountains...

14:55.210 --> 14:58.160
But life was kind of boring that way,

14:58.620 --> 15:01.280
so I went on a journey, 
where I ran into you,

15:01.280 --> 15:02.630
who saved me!

15:03.630 --> 15:05.840
Feels kind of like fate!

15:06.860 --> 15:09.300
Now, tell me about you, Rein!

15:14.440 --> 15:17.140
Then you were in the Hero's party, Rein?

15:17.140 --> 15:19.180
Yeah. Only for six months, though.

15:20.380 --> 15:21.740
<i>This is strange...</i>

15:23.000 --> 15:26.970
<i>Thinking about it has been so depressing, 
I never told anyone else,</i>

15:27.950 --> 15:30.400
<i>but I'm telling Kanade everything.</i>

15:32.110 --> 15:33.740
And that's how it went...

15:36.100 --> 15:36.910
Kanade?

15:37.590 --> 15:39.600
That Hero ought to be ashamed!

15:39.600 --> 15:41.500
I can't believe he kicked you out...

15:45.190 --> 15:47.920
When you're such a nice person!

15:48.580 --> 15:50.880
Are you mad on my behalf?

15:50.880 --> 15:52.280
Of course I am!

15:52.280 --> 15:55.090
Because Rein, you're... I...

16:00.570 --> 16:03.710
You're really sweet, Kanade. 
But it's okay now.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.830
They were right about me being a hindrance,

16:07.830 --> 16:11.570
and I doubt any good would have come 
from staying in that party.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.260
Okay.

16:14.820 --> 16:17.490
If you're not mad, Rein, then I'm not mad.

16:17.490 --> 16:19.120
Still kinda frustrated though...

16:20.330 --> 16:21.050
Yeah.

16:21.510 --> 16:23.710
Thank you, though.

16:25.040 --> 16:27.230
<i>Oh, no! That was on reflex...</i>

16:30.980 --> 16:33.930
<i>What a relief. She doesn't seem to mind.</i>

16:34.510 --> 16:37.550
But I want to make one thing clear.

16:37.550 --> 16:39.940
You're not useless at all, Rein!

16:39.940 --> 16:42.110
If anything, you're really strong!

16:42.110 --> 16:44.140
But I'm just a Beast Tamer.

16:44.140 --> 16:46.940
And you've got an incredible gift for it!

16:46.940 --> 16:48.130
The reason being...

16:48.130 --> 16:51.440
I'm pretty sure you could tame me, Rein.

16:53.950 --> 16:56.090
How do I put this?

16:56.090 --> 17:00.800
It's like the second I saw you, 
I felt this buzzing, like electricity!

17:00.800 --> 17:05.200
I thought that you would be 
able to tame me.

17:05.200 --> 17:10.940
There are only a handful of people in the 
whole world who can tame Cat Spirits!

17:10.940 --> 17:13.370
Which means you're really amazing, Rein!

17:15.590 --> 17:18.150
Me, taming a Cat Spirit?

17:18.150 --> 17:19.990
I never even considered it before...

17:19.990 --> 17:21.180
Come on, Rein!

17:23.540 --> 17:25.600
Try taming me!

17:29.040 --> 17:31.190
<i>If I could actually tame
an ultimate species...</i>

17:31.920 --> 17:34.540
<i>It would be an unimaginably big help.</i>

17:35.650 --> 17:38.640
<i>Nothing like that would ever happen again.</i>

17:39.060 --> 17:40.760
<i>With an ultimate species...</i>

17:42.080 --> 17:44.540
Feels kind of like fate!

17:44.900 --> 17:47.040
<i>Oh... that's right.</i>

17:48.160 --> 17:50.470
<i>It's not because she's from
 an ultimate species.</i>

17:51.440 --> 17:55.420
<i>I want to get to know Kanade better.</i>

17:55.950 --> 17:58.130
Okay. Let's try it.

17:59.860 --> 18:00.850
Yeah!

18:22.610 --> 18:24.390
My name is Rein Shroud.

18:28.510 --> 18:32.350
In establishing this new contract,
 a bond is formed.

18:34.030 --> 18:37.340
An oath in our hearts, hopes in our souls...

18:38.100 --> 18:39.700
Your power, in my hand.

18:40.650 --> 18:43.440
Speak now your name.

18:44.100 --> 18:48.490
<i>If Kanade gives her name now, 
the contract will be formed.</i>

18:48.490 --> 18:50.270
<i>Otherwise...</i>

18:54.270 --> 18:55.380
Kanade.

19:11.370 --> 19:12.540
Did it work?

19:12.870 --> 19:15.270
Yep. The contract is sealed.

19:15.270 --> 19:17.460
Look at the palm of your hand.

19:18.260 --> 19:20.810
There's some kind of weird pattern!

19:20.810 --> 19:24.260
It's the symbol of what links us.

19:24.920 --> 19:27.530
You and I are contracted now, Kanade.

19:27.530 --> 19:32.410
Really? Then this means you 
and I are bound together, huh!

19:32.410 --> 19:33.770
That's great!

19:33.770 --> 19:34.870
Bound together?

19:35.570 --> 19:37.670
Was I wrong?

19:37.670 --> 19:39.790
No, you're right.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.990
It symbolizes our bond, Kanade!

19:44.290 --> 19:45.060
Yeah!

19:47.690 --> 19:50.270
It's a pleasure to be 
traveling with you, Rein!

19:50.270 --> 19:51.620
The feeling is mutual!

19:55.390 --> 19:56.790
Wha—hey!

19:57.390 --> 20:01.450
<i>There are the ultimate species, 
with inexplicable power...</i>

20:01.760 --> 20:05.740
<i>I was a Beast Tamer kicked 
out of the Hero's party,</i>

20:05.740 --> 20:07.400
<i>bereft of a goal or any comrades...</i>

20:07.890 --> 20:11.520
<i>And now one of the ultimate 
species is working with me.</i>

21:46.820 --> 21:49.610
Hey, aren't we going back to town?

21:49.610 --> 21:52.740
I need to finish my adventurer's trial first.

21:53.190 --> 21:55.600
I think they should be 
around here somewhere....

21:56.010 --> 21:57.210
Ah, there we go.

21:57.210 --> 21:58.410
Rabbits?

21:58.410 --> 22:01.440
Yep. First, a temporary contract...

22:05.460 --> 22:07.010
There he goes.

22:07.010 --> 22:10.030
But, wait, Rein how can you—

22:10.030 --> 22:11.820
Next, he brings his friends over.

22:11.820 --> 22:12.810
Friends?!

22:15.020 --> 22:17.510
I'm in fluffy heaven!

22:17.510 --> 22:20.730
Then I form temporary 
contracts with all of them.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.370
Okay, everyone,

22:27.370 --> 22:30.910
I need you to look for medicinal herbs 
in the area and bring them to me.

22:31.520 --> 22:33.940
Be careful not to mistake them 
for food and eat them!

22:34.720 --> 22:36.080
Okay, off you go.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.520
That ought to do it...

22:41.580 --> 22:43.020
What's wrong?

22:43.020 --> 22:44.550
What the heck is going on?!

22:44.960 --> 22:49.410
You were able to tame so many at once! 
And give them complex commands!

22:49.410 --> 22:51.730
Is that really so rare?

22:51.730 --> 22:53.390
You bet it is!

22:53.390 --> 22:59.190
<b>Normal</b>

22:53.790 --> 22:59.090
Even with temporary contracts, most Beast 
Tamers can only handle one at a time!

22:58.980 --> 23:04.110
<b>Weird</b>

22:59.090 --> 23:02.100
Not to mention, you've tamed me,

23:02.100 --> 23:04.110
so you shouldn't be able to do any more, Rein!

23:04.110 --> 23:08.820
I mean, I know I said you were 
an amazing Beast Tamer, but...

23:08.820 --> 23:11.020
This is supposed to be impossible!

23:11.020 --> 23:13.320
Huh, you know a lot 
about this stuff, Kanade.

23:13.320 --> 23:14.630
How is this happening?!

23:14.630 --> 23:17.730
I've never heard of a Beast Tamer
 doing all this at once!

23:17.730 --> 23:19.170
I'm not sure what to tell you...

23:19.880 --> 23:22.940
Back home, everyone can do this sort of thing.

23:23.570 --> 23:25.960
It's just normal for 
a Beast Tamer, isn't it?

23:26.940 --> 23:29.240
It's not even kind of normal!

23:29.240 --> 23:33.040
And you called me inexplicable?!

23:35.640 --> 23:40.020
(Comrades)

23:36.500 --> 23:38.730
Next time: "Comrades."
